# Analyzing_Employee's_Data

A small data analysis project, focused on analyzing employee data. This project was assigned by the Workearly [Machine Learning and AI Bootcamp](https://academy.workearly.services/course/machine-learning-and-ai-bootcamp).Â 

### Project Overview

We been given a dataset called employees.csv, encompassing information on several company employees. Our mission involves utilizing SQL for initial data refinement, followed by Python for detailed analysis and data visualization. Our main objectives are the following: 

- Extract specific subsets of data using SQL.
- Implement Python for data computations.
- Engage libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for thorough data scrutiny and visual presentations.

### Data Sources

Our main data source is the employees.csv that was provided by the [Machine Learning and AI Bootcamp](https://academy.workearly.services/course/machine-learning-and-ai-bootcamp)

### Tools

- WPS Sheets - Preliminary Data Inspection
- Big Query Sandbox (SQL) - Extracting specific subsets
- Anaconda Navigator/Spyder (Python) - Data Analysis, Data Computations, Data Visualizations
